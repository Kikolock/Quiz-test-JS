## Quiz test >>> JavaScript Challenge

## Technologies used and why.

For this project, I need to create a application as a timed quiz with multiple-coice questions. This app will run in the browser but has a responsive layout for different viewports.

## Challenges for future improvement

During this project I had been trough challenges as searching online for the JavaScript functions and how to use them in order to have the best outcome. Using HTML and CSS interface, the power from JavaScript will give the function to the page.

## The Project

This challenge consists in creating a timed quiz with a highscore board:

- When clicks on the button to start quiz, the timer starts and the user is presented with a question
- When a question is answered, another question comes after.
- If the answer is correct, the timer will continue to run, if the answer is incorrect, will be a timer penalty
- When all questions are answered or timer reaches to 0, the game is over and then the user can save his initials and score
- When resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
